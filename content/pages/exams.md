The 3 in-class tests are composed entirely from a subset of the problem sets. The tests are "closed book," but students may bring a one-sided sheet of formulas.

All topics presented in the course will be covered in the final exam, with emphasis on the second half. The exam is closed book, but students may bring a two-sided sheet of formulas.
